# FluidCore

## Introduction
FluidCore is an elastic object implementation for .NET Standard.
FluidCore targets .NET Standard 2.0.

## Concept
The **Elastic object** concept was first introduced by <a href="http://www.amazedsaint.com/" target="_blank">Anoop Madhusudanan</a> (aka, <a href="http://twitter.com/amazedsaint" target="_blank">@amazedsaint</a>) in a <a href="http://www.amazedsaint.com/2010/02/introducing-elasticobject-for-net-40.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> some time ago.
This is my take on it, which is somewhat different from the original approach. Not a single line was copied, all of this was created by myself.
